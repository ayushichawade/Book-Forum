# Book Recommendation System

## Introduction

A recommendation system filters and provides personalized suggestions based on user preferences and past behavior. It is widely used in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and online marketplaces. By leveraging algorithms such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, this project improves recommendation accuracy, user engagement, and satisfaction.

Hybrid approaches, which combine collaborative and content-based techniques, are implemented to overcome the limitations of single-method recommenders. Additionally, neural networks enhance the system's ability to learn and adapt to complex user behaviors, making the recommendations more precise over time.

## Paper Abstract

This project is based on the concepts outlined in the published paper: **"Enhancing Book Recommendations in Android Applications Using Autoencoders and Hybrid Filtering"**.

The paper focuses on using advanced recommendation techniques within Android applications for personalized book recommendations. Collaborative filtering techniques analyze user interactions, while hybrid filtering combines different recommendation models to offer more accurate suggestions. The system also includes genre-based recommendations, a wishlist feature, and a forum for discussions. This solution highlights the innovative use of machine learning in the book industry.

## About the Project

The digital era has transformed how we discover and engage with books. This project focuses on creating a book recommendation system that leverages advanced recommendation techniques such as **autoencoders**, **collaborative filtering**, and **hybrid filtering algorithms**. The system is designed to provide personalized book recommendations based on user ratings, reading history, and behaviors. In addition to this, the system includes features such as:

- **Popular Book Recommendations**
- **Genre-Based Suggestions**
- **Wishlist Creation**
- **Book Uploads by Users (as Authors)**
- **Admin Portal for Efficient Moderation**
- **User Forum for Book Discussions**

This project enhances user satisfaction by creating a seamless reading experience, ultimately increasing engagement with the platform.

## Features

- **Personalized Book Recommendations:** Using autoencoders and collaborative filtering, the system generates personalized reading suggestions.
- **Hybrid Filtering:** A combination of collaborative and content-based filtering provides accurate and diverse recommendations.
- **User Wishlist and Book Uploads:** Users can create wishlists and even upload their own books.
- **Admin Portal:** Efficient moderation and management of uploaded books.
- **Discussion Forum:** Users can participate in discussions about specific books or chapters.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras (for autoencoders and neural networks)
- **Algorithms:** Collaborative Filtering, Hybrid Filtering
- **Platform:** Android (for app integration)
